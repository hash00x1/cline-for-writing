Meet Cline Writer, an AI assistant designed specifically for professional writers in **academic research**, **screenwriting**, and **novel writing**.

Thanks to [Claude 3.7 Sonnet's advanced reasoning capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet), Cline Writer can handle complex writing projects step-by-step. With specialized tools for planning, researching, and drafting, it can assist you in ways that go beyond simple text generation. Cline Writer can even use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with research databases, citation managers, and other writing tools. The extension provides a human-in-the-loop interface where you approve every outline, research note, and draft, ensuring you remain in complete control of your writing process.

## How Cline Writer Works

1. **Plan**: Tell Cline Writer about your writing project - whether it's a research paper, screenplay, or novel. It can help you create detailed outlines, conduct literature reviews, and organize your project structure.

2. **Research**: Cline Writer analyzes your project goals and existing materials in the `memory_bank` folder to understand your writing context. It can help gather sources, summarize research, and maintain citation databases.

3. **Write**: Once Cline has the information needed, it can:
    - Generate detailed outlines for academic papers, screenplays, or novels
    - Draft chapters, scenes, or sections based on your project state
    - Conduct literature reviews and summarize research findings
    - Manage citations and bibliographies for academic work
    - Develop character arcs and plot structures for creative writing
    - Review and suggest improvements to existing drafts

4. **Iterate**: When a writing task is completed, Cline Writer presents the result in your preferred format, whether it's markdown, LaTeX, or specialized screenplay formats.

## Key Features

- **Academic Writing**: Literature reviews, research organization, citation management, thesis/dissertation support
- **Screenwriting**: Scene planning, character development, dialogue refinement, industry-standard formatting
- **Novel Writing**: Plot development, character arcs, world-building, chapter structuring
- **Project Memory**: Notes on all your outlines, research, and drafts are stored in the `memory_bank` folder for continuity
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for Markdown, LaTeX, Fountain (screenplay), and other writing formats

> [!TIP]
> Use the `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P` shortcut to open the command palette and type "Cline Writer: Open In New Tab" to open the extension as a tab in your editor. This lets you use Cline Writer side-by-side with your documents and project files.

### Use any AI Model for Writing

Cline Writer supports API providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, GCP Vertex, and others. You can also configure any OpenAI compatible API, or use a local model through LM Studio/Ollama. The extension fetches the latest model lists, allowing you to use the newest writing-optimized models as soon as they're available.

The extension keeps track of total tokens and API usage cost for your entire writing project, keeping you informed of usage every step of the way.
