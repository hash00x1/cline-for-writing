@ mentions are one of Cline's most powerful features, letting you seamlessly bring external context into your conversations. Instead of copying and pasting chapters, research notes, or links, you can simply reference them with an @ symbol.

When you type `@` in the chat input, Cline shows a menu of available mention types. These mentions let you reference files, folders, research notes, and web content directly in your conversations.

## Available @ Mentions

## Why @ Mentions Matter

@ mentions transform how you interact with Cline by:

1. **Eliminating copy-paste**: No more copying chapters or research links by hand. Just reference them directly.

2. **Preserving context**: Cline sees the full text around your reference, ensuring edits stay consistent.

3. **Maintaining formatting**: Web pages and notes keep their formatting, making citations easier.

4. **Enabling complex workflows**: Combine multiple @ mentions to give Cline a complete picture of your work:

    ```
    Here's my outline: @/outline.md

    Include this reference: @https://example.com/article

    Don't forget my notes: @notes
    ```

## Getting Started

To use @ mentions:

1. Type `@` in the chat input
2. Select the type of mention from the menu or continue typing
3. For files and folders, navigate through your workspace structure
4. Send your message as usual

Cline will automatically process the mentions and include the referenced content in the context sent to the AI.

Try using @ mentions in your next conversation with Cline - you'll be amazed at how much more efficient and effective your interactions become when you can seamlessly bring in external context.

## How It Works Under the Hood

When you use @ mentions in your messages, there's a sophisticated process happening behind the scenes:

1. **Detection**: When you send a message, Cline scans the text for @ mention patterns using regular expressions
2. **Processing**: For each detected mention, Cline:
    - Determines the mention type (file, folder, problems, terminal, git, URL)
    - Fetches the relevant content (file contents, terminal output, etc.)
    - Formats the content appropriately
3. **Enhancement**: The original message is enhanced with structured data:

    ```
    Your original message with @/path/to/file

    <file_content path="/path/to/file">
    [Complete file content]
    </file_content>
    ```

4. **Context Inclusion**: This enhanced message with all the embedded content is sent to the AI model
5. **Seamless Response**: The AI can now "see" all the referenced content as if you had manually copied and pasted it

This entire process happens automatically and seamlessly whenever you use @ mentions, giving the AI complete context without you having to manually copy anything.

Each type of @ mention has its own specific implementation details, which you can find in their respective documentation pages.
