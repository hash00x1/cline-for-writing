### What are Editor Integrations?

Editor integrations let you use Cline right where you're writing. Instead of copying and pasting passages into chat, you can highlight text, right-click, and ask Cline to outline, edit, or summarize.
These integrations appear in different places throughout VSCode:

-   In the editor context menu (right-click menu) - "Send to Cline"
-   As keyboard shortcuts - Various Cline commands
-   As Quick Fix options (lightbulb menu) - "Rewrite with Cline", "Summarize with Cline"

### Available Editor Integrations

Cline offers several editor integrations, each designed to enhance different aspects of your development workflow:

### How They Work

When you use these commands, Cline:

-   Captures the relevant context (selected text, file path, or reference)
-   Focuses the Cline interface
-   Creates a conversation with the captured context
-   In some cases, automatically generates a suggested prompt

Behind the scenes, these commands use VSCode's extension API to register commands, access editor state, and control VSCode's interface.
