Cline includes several tools designed specifically for long-form writing projects. Below are the most common ones and examples of how to use them.

## Outline Mode

Use Outline mode to plan the structure of a novel, paper, or script before drafting.

```text
/newtask mode:outline
```

Cline will prompt you for a high-level summary and then generate a chapter or scene breakdown.

## Draft Mode

Draft mode lets Cline expand sections of your outline into full prose. Provide the outline file or paragraph you want to develop and Cline will keep the structure intact.

```text
/draft @/outline.md section:2
```

This command asks Cline to focus on the second section of your outline.

## Reference Manager

The `reference_lookup` tool fetches citations for academic writing. Provide a DOI or URL and Cline will insert a formatted reference.

```xml
<reference_lookup>
<url>https://doi.org/10.1000/example</url>
<style>APA</style>
</reference_lookup>
```

## Screenplay Formatter

When working on a script, use the `format_screenplay` tool to ensure that scenes follow standard screenplay conventions.

```xml
<format_screenplay>
<path>scenes/scene1.md</path>
</format_screenplay>
```

These tools combined with Plan and Draft modes help you manage large writing projects from outline to finished manuscript.
