Plan & Draft modes help writers move from brainstorming to polished prose. Planning keeps ideas organized, while Draft mode turns those plans into chapters, papers, or scenes.

#### Plan Mode: Think First

Plan mode is where you and Cline Writer shape the outline of your work. In this mode, Cline Writer:

-   Can read your existing drafts or research notes to understand the context
-   Won't alter your files yet
-   Focuses on organizing ideas and creating a structure
-   Helps identify gaps before you draft a single paragraph

#### Draft Mode: Write It

Once the outline is ready, switch to Draft mode. Now Cline Writer:

-   Expands sections using the agreed plan
-   Can modify your manuscript or script files
-   Keeps everything from the planning session in context
-   Executes the structure you created together

### Workflow Guide

When outlining a novel or organizing a research paper, here's what works for me:

1. I start in Plan mode and explain the concept or thesis
2. Cline Writer helps me review existing notes and sources
3. Together we craft a chapter or section outline
4. When I'm confident in the outline, I switch to Draft mode
5. Cline Writer expands each section according to the plan

#### 1. Start with Plan Mode

Begin every significant writing project in Plan mode:

In this mode:

-   Share your requirements
-   Let Cline analyze relevant files
-   Engage in dialogue to clarify objectives
-   Develop implementation strategy

#### 2. Switch to Draft Mode

Once you have a clear outline, switch to Draft mode:

</Frame>

Draft mode allows Cline to:

-   Execute against the agreed outline
-   Edit your manuscript files
-   Maintain context from planning phase

#### 3. Iterate as Needed

Long projects often require multiple plan-draft cycles:

-   Return to Plan mode when adding new ideas or research
-   Use Draft mode for writing passages
-   Maintain momentum while keeping structure intact

### Best Practices

#### Planning Phase

1. Be comprehensive with requirements
2. Share relevant context upfront
3. Point Cline to relevant files if he hasn't read them
4. Validate approach before implementation

#### Implementation Phase

1. Follow the established plan
2. Monitor progress against objectives
3. Track changes and their impact
4. Document significant decisions

### Power User Tips

#### Enhancing Planning

-   Use Plan mode to explore edge cases before implementation
-   Switch back to Plan when encountering unexpected complexity
-   Leverage [file reading](/features/at-mentions/file-mentions) to validate assumptions early
-   Have Cline write markdown files of the plan for future reference

### Common Patterns

#### When to Use Each Mode

I've found Plan mode works best when:

-   Starting a new story or article and the structure isn't clear
-   Researching sources and deciding how to cite them
-   Mapping character arcs or key arguments
-   Evaluating feedback before large revisions

And Draft mode is perfect for:

-   Expanding an outline we've already agreed on
-   Polishing dialogue or paragraphs
-   Incorporating citations or scene directions
-   Making incremental improvements
