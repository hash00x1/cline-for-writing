# Obsidian MCP Server Integration Plan

## Overview
Integrate Cline for Writers with Obsidian vaults using the existing mcp-obsidian server implementation, enabling seamless bi-directional synchronization and collaborative writing workflows.

**Status Update**: An existing MCP server for Obsidian (mcp-obsidian by MarkusPfundstein) provides the foundation for this integration. We can build a WritingCard bridge on top of this server rather than creating a new one.

## Phase 1: WritingCard Bridge Implementation

### Core Bridge Components

1. **WritingCard Mapping**
   - Map WritingCard.id to Obsidian note filenames
   - Store WritingCard metadata in frontmatter
   - Preserve WritingCard content as note body
   - Sync position data for corkboard layout

2. **MCP Server Configuration**
   - Use existing mcp-obsidian server
   - Configure with Obsidian REST API plugin
   - Set up auto-approval for read operations
   - Handle authentication and connection

3. **Bidirectional Sync Service**
   - Real-time sync between Cline and Obsidian
   - Conflict resolution with timestamps
   - Batch operations for performance
   - Incremental updates only

4. **Memory Bank Integration**
   - Sync memory_bank folder to Obsidian
   - Maintain project context across platforms
   - Handle structured templates and research notes

5. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Robust connection management
   - Graceful fallback when Obsidian unavailable
   - Data integrity checks and validation

### Using Existing MCP Tools

The mcp-obsidian server provides these tools that we'll use in our bridge:

1. **list_files_in_vault** - Discover all writing cards
2. **get_file_contents** - Read individual WritingCard data  
3. **search** - Find cards by content or metadata
4. **append_content** - Create new WritingCards
5. **patch_content** - Update existing cards
6. **delete_file** - Remove cards when needed

### WritingCard Data Mapping

The old journal felt heavy in Emma's hands as she discovered it hidden behind the loose floorboard. Its leather cover was worn smooth by countless hands, and mysterious symbols were etched along its edges.

She opened it carefully, afraid the aged pages might crumble at her touch...
