# Cline for Writers + Obsidian Integration Summary

## Key Integration Strategy

**Use existing mcp-obsidian server** + **Build WritingCard bridge** = Seamless integration

## Core Mapping

| Cline Component | Obsidian Equivalent | Implementation |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| WritingCard | Note with frontmatter | `{card-id}.md` |
| WritingCard.content | Note body | Markdown content |
| WritingCard.metadata | Frontmatter YAML | Structured metadata |
| WritingCard.position | Frontmatter position | Visual layout data |
| ContentChunk | Folder/Canvas | Organizational structure |
| Memory Bank | `memory_bank/` folder | Project context |

## Required Setup

1. **Install Obsidian REST API Plugin**
   - Enable in Obsidian community plugins
   - Copy API key for configuration

2. **Configure mcp-obsidian Server**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-writer": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["mcp-obsidian"],
         "env": {
           "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-key-here",
           "OBSIDIAN_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
           "OBSIDIAN_PORT": "27124"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Bridge Service**
   - `ObsidianWritingCardBridge` - Core CRUD operations
   - `ObsidianMemoryBankSync` - Project context sync
   - `ObsidianIntegration` - Main controller

## Benefits

✅ **Bidirectional sync** - Changes in either tool reflect in both  
✅ **Rich ecosystem** - Access to hundreds of Obsidian plugins  
✅ **Visual mapping** - Canvas integration for story structure  
✅ **Mobile access** - Edit cards on mobile via Obsidian app  
✅ **Powerful search** - Leverage Obsidian's advanced search  
✅ **Graph view** - Visualize connections between cards  
✅ **Community** - Join existing Obsidian writing community  

## Example WritingCard in Obsidian

```markdown
---
title: "Chapter 1: The Discovery"
card_id: "card-ch1-discovery"
status: "draft"
tags: ["chapter", "opening", "mystery"]
chunk_id: "chapter-1"
position: {x: 100, y: 150, width: 300, height: 200}
word_count: 245

# Chapter 1: The Discovery

Emma found the old journal hidden behind a loose floorboard in her grandmother's attic. The leather cover was worn smooth, and mysterious symbols were etched along its edges.

As she opened it carefully, the aged pages seemed to whisper secrets of the past...

[[Character - Emma]] discovers [[Object - Grandmother's Journal]] in [[Location - Attic]]
```

This creates a powerful writing system that combines:
- Cline's AI assistance and project management
- Obsidian's powerful linking, search, and plugin ecosystem  
- Seamless bidirectional synchronization
- Rich visual organization tools
