Cline Writer is an AI writing assistant which integrates with Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It provides an interface between your editor and LLMs facilitating academic writing, creative writing, and research projects, increasing productivity and lowering the barrier to entry for new writers. Depending on permissions, Cline Writer can read/write documents, execute research commands, use your web browser for fact-checking, and expand its capabilities with Model Context Protocol servers.

What makes Cline Writer distinctive is its thoughtful approach to the writing process and its extensive integration capabilities. Rather than simply generating text snippets, Cline Writer collaborates with writers by planning projects step-by-step, maintaining awareness of the entire writing project, and requiring explicit approval for all changes. It can understand large manuscripts, accelerate research for academic projects, and connect with writing tools through its Model Context Protocol Marketplace, enabling everything from citation management to research database accessâ€”all through natural language commands.
