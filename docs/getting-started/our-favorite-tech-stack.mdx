## Recommended Setup for New Writers

### Core Tools

- **VS Code** with the Cline extension installed
- **Markdown** for easy version control of outlines and drafts
- **Zotero** or your favorite reference manager for research-heavy projects

### Example Workflow

1. Start a project folder and create an `outline.md` file.
2. Use **Outline Mode** to sketch chapters, sections, or scenes.
3. Switch to **Draft Mode** to expand each item in your outline.
4. Keep notes and references in a `references/` folder so Cline can cite them when drafting.

### Sample Project Structure

```text
my-writing-project/
├─ outline.md
├─ chapters/
│  ├─ chapter1.md
│  └─ chapter2.md
├─ references/
│  └─ research-notes.md
```

Organizing your work like this helps Cline maintain context and makes it easy to move between planning and writing phases.
