Before you dive into a novel, screenplay, or research paper, make sure you have these essentials ready:

-   Install the **Cline** extension from the Marketplace.

> âœ… **Pro Tip:** Place VS Code in your Applications folder (macOS) or Program Files (Windows) for quick access.

#### 2. **Organize Your Projects**

Create a folder named `ClineWriting` in your Documents folder for all your drafts:

-   **macOS:** `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/ClineWriting`
-   **Windows:** `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\ClineWriting`

Inside, organize by project:

-   `ClineWriting/my-screenplay`
-   `ClineWriting/my-thesis`

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** A clear structure helps Cline Writer track your outlines, drafts, and research notes.
