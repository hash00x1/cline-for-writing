> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you're completely new to creative writing, take your time with each step. There's no rush â€” Cline is here to help shape your ideas!

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Before you dive into a novel, screenplay, or research paper, make sure you have these essentials ready:

#### 1. **VS Code**

A flexible editor that's perfect for drafting text.

-   [<u>Download VS Code</u>](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   Install the **Cline** extension from the Marketplace.

> âœ… **Pro Tip:** Place VS Code in your Applications folder (macOS) or Program Files (Windows) for quick access.

#### 2. **Organize Your Projects**

Create a folder named `ClineWriting` in your Documents folder for all your drafts:

-   **macOS:** `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/ClineWriting`
-   **Windows:** `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\ClineWriting`

Inside, organize by project:

-   `ClineWriting/my-novel`
-   `ClineWriting/my-screenplay`
-   `ClineWriting/my-thesis`

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** A clear structure helps Cline track your outlines, drafts, and research notes.

#### 3. **Outline Mode**

Use **Outline Mode** to brainstorm scenes or sections before writing:

1. Open a new task and choose **Outline Mode**.
2. Describe the premise of your story, paper, or script.
3. Let Cline suggest chapter breakdowns, research sections, or scene lists.

> âœ… **Pro Tip:** Save the outline in your project folder so you can refine it later.

#### 4. **Draft Mode**

Switch to **Draft Mode** when you're ready to expand the outline into full text. Cline will keep the structure intact while helping you write scenes or sections.

ðŸŽ‰ You're all set! Start exploring your ideas with **Cline** and build your first draft.
